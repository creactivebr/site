# [Creactive Soluções Tecnológicas](https://creactive.com.br)

This is our site. There are many like it, but this one is ours.


## Getting Started

### If you use Docker

Good! We like Docker too. Run the following commands to spawn our website:

```
docker build . --tag creactive-site
docker run -p 5000:5000 creactive-site
```

Now open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) on your favorite browser and that's it.


### If you do not use Docker

Aww! It is a shame that you do not use [Docker](https://docker.com). Perhaps give it a try later. Anyway, it's a one page html site my dude, not rocket science. Just run it with any static file server and you're good. I like to use [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve):

        npx serve

Now open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) on your favorite browser and that's it.
